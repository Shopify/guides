<em class="t-gray">Want to better protect your rubygems.org account?</em>

Your rubygems.org account is important! Unauthorized access of your account
can lead to irrevocable damage to your gem's reputation. We highly recommend
that you enable MFA for both UI and API.

You may enable MFA using [one-time passwords (OTP)](/setting-up-otp-mfa).
