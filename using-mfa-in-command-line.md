<em class="t-gray">How to use multifactor authentication with gem CLI.</em>

Multifactor authentication (MFA) greatly increases the security of your account.
RubyGems currently requires that owners of any gem with more than 180 million
cumulative downloads must enable MFA.

You may enable MFA using [one-time passwords (OTP)](/using-otp-mfa-in-command-line).
