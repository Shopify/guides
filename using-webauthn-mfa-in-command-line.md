<em class="t-gray">How to use WebAuthn MFA with gem CLI.</em>

Multifactor authentication (MFA) using WebAuthn works by using a
removable hardware token or touch biometric / facial biometric capabilities built
into your phone or computer. This is distinct from MFA based on typing or copying
a code generated by an authentication app or password manager, called OTP. For
OTP MFA see "[Using OTP multifactor authentication in command line](/ using-otp-mfa-in-command-line)".

When you have enabled WebAuthn MFA we will ask you to perform authentication for
`gem signin`. Check "[Setting up WebAuthn multifactor authentication](/setting-up-webauthn-multifactor-authentication)"
for guidance on setting up WebAuthn MFA.

    Enter your RubyGems.org credentials.

    Password:

    [snip of API key setup]

    You have enabled multi-factor authentication.
    Please visit http://localhost:3000/webauthn_verification/<random>?port=<port>
    to authenticate via security device. If you can't verify using WebAuthn but
    have OTP enabled, you can re-run the gem signin command with the `--otp [your_code]`
    option.

Depending on your terminal program, you may be able to click, command-click or
control-click on the link to open it in your default browser. Otherwise you will
need to copy and paste the link into a new tab.

A webpage titled "Authenticate with Security Device" appears. Click "Authenticate".
Your browser will show a popup asking you to use a Passkey or other authentication
device (the exact popup will vary according to the browser).

Once you have authenticated using your WebAuthn device device, you will see a
"Success" page. At this point you can close your browser tab and return to the
command line, which will say:

    You are verified with a security device. You may close the browser window.
    Signed in with API key: <your API key name>
